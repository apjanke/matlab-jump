# JUMP for Matlab

JUMP is a tool that makes it easier to write custom Java code for use in a Matlab environment.

JUMP stands for "Java Uniform Provision for Matlab". (Yes, I see that the "MP" is backwards. Artistic license.)

JUMP provides:

* A Maven POM with dependencies on most of the third-party JARs shipped with Matlab
* A convenient redistribution of the Javadoc for those libraries
